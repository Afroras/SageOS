SageOS

This is my implementation of BYU's cs345 project. It is designed to run on Windows machines with the MinGW compiler.
Some extraneous files (generated by my IDE, Code::Blocks) are also present.

The projects in the class change periodically. As of Winter 2014, they are as follows:

Project 1- Shell
Project 2- Tasking
Project 3- Jurassic Park
Project 4- Virtual Memory
Project 5- Scheduling
Project 6- FAT

Executables are in /bin/Debug or /bin/Release.
For my own diversion, I have added:
-a sqlite database, which is used to remember commands (see sqlite3.c, bufHist.c)
-a logging system (see logger.c)
These are not required for the class.

Project 3 (command: p3) outputs the park ASCII art to a text file, to leave the command line free to type in.
